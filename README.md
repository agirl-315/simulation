Upload the code in zip format, after decompressing, it becomes m files, suitable for Matlab. Here are three figures from Figure 3 as references, and the rest of the figures are drawn similarly.

SOURCE CODE FOR FIGURES
data.xlsx: The real data points of hand, foot and mouth disease for parameter estimation in Figure 1.

gamma1eta: After decompressing, there are three m files, "err_in_data", "main", and "Model_l". The file named "main" (where "err_in_data" and "Model_l" are the required functions) can be executed to reproduce the (c) image in Figure 3.

sigmac: After decompressing, there are three m files, "err_in_data", "main", and "Model_l". The file named "main" (where "err_in_data" and "Model_l" are the required functions) can be executed to reproduce the (d) image in Figure 3.

sigmagamma1: After decompressing, there are three m files, "err_in_data", "main", and "Model_l". The file named "main" (where "err_in_data" and "Model_l" are the required functions) can be executed to reproduce the (i) image in Figure 3.
