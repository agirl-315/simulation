Upload the code in zip format, after decompressing, it becomes m files, suitable for Matlab. Here are three figures from Figure 3 as references, and the rest of the figures are drawn similarly.

SOURCE CODE FOR FIGURES

data.xlsx: The real data points of hand, foot and mouth disease for parameter estimation in Figure 1.

gamma1eta: After decompressing, there are three m files, "err_in_data", "main", and "Model_l". The file named "main" (where "err_in_data" and "Model_l" are the required functions) can be executed to reproduce the (c) image in Figure 3.

sigmac: After decompressing, there are three m files, "err_in_data", "main", and "Model_l". The file named "main" (where "err_in_data" and "Model_l" are the required functions) can be executed to reproduce the (d) image in Figure 3.

sigmagamma1: After decompressing, there are three m files, "err_in_data", "main", and "Model_l". The file named "main" (where "err_in_data" and "Model_l" are the required functions) can be executed to reproduce the (i) image in Figure 3.

PRCC: After decompressing, there are two m files, "prccfinall" and "Model_l". The file named "prccfinall" (where "Model_l" are the required function) can be executed to reproduce the (a) image in Figure 7. And hide line 107 of file "prccfinall" and remove the hidden line 106, resulting in (b) image in Figure 7.
